code-sample
===========

A small project to demonstrate some Android development-features, and use as a test-bed for stuff. 
As far as applications go, it's not that interesting; it grabs a feed of Flickr-photos, and shows them
in a list.

What it actually demonstrates:
* Kotlin
* Dagger 2
* RxJava
* Android support stuff (cardview, recycleview)
* Android architectural components (MVVM, data binding, livedata)
* Http calls using Retrofit
* Image loading using Glide
* Testing

Still in progress:
* Mocking the ViewModel for UI testing :/
